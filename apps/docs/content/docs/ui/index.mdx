## Introduction

Fumadocs is a **documentation framework** based on Next.js, designed to be fast and flexible.
It composes seamlessly into Next.js App Router, and benefits from the React Server Component (RSC) model.

We separated Fumadocs into multiple parts:

<h4 className="inline-flex items-center gap-2">
  <CpuIcon className="text-purple-300 p-0.5 border rounded-lg" />
  <span>Core</span>
</h4>

The core of Fumadocs.
Just like the CPU, it handles most of the logic, including document search, content source adapters, and Markdown/MDX plugins.

<h4 className="inline-flex items-center gap-2">
  <PanelsTopLeft className="text-blue-300 p-0.5 border rounded-lg" />
  <span>UI</span>
</h4>

The default theme of Fumadocs, it offers a beautiful look for documentation sites and many interactive components.

<h4 className="inline-flex items-center gap-2">
  <Database className="text-muted-foreground p-0.5 border rounded-lg" />
  <span>Content Source</span>
</h4>

The input/source of your content, it can be a CMS, or local data layers like [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev) and [Fumadocs MDX](/docs/mdx).

Fumadocs Core will process your content source, hence theoretically any kind of format and source can be supported by Fumadocs.

> Fumadocs MDX is the official content source of Fumadocs.

### Use Cases

### Documentation

Fumadocs focuses on **authoring experience**, it provides a beautiful theme and many docs automation tools.

It helps you to iterate your codebase faster while never leaving your docs behind.
You can take this site as an example of docs site built with Fumadocs.

### Blog sites

Since Next.js is already a powerful framework, most features can be implemented with **only Next.js**.

Fumadocs Core can process the content (e.g. syntax highlighting), and you can render it with the default theme (Fumadocs UI) or your custom theme.
It is particularly helpful if you want to build complicated things like search.

### Terminology

For a better understanding of the docs, there are some common terminologies you should know:

**Page Tree:** A tree of all the pages, separators and folders. It is essential for navigation elements. Types definitions can be found at [Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree).

**MDX File & Page:** A MDX file could be located in a folder, or available remotely. Instead, MDX Page is only referring to `page.mdx`, which is already a page on its own.

You might need to be familiar with Next.js App Router to continue.

## Automatic Installation

Create a new app with `create-fumadocs-app`, it requires Node.js 18+.

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>

```bash tab="npm"
npx create-fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create fumadocs-app
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun create fumadocs-app
```

</Tabs>

It will ask you the following questions:

- Which content source to use? (Recommended: Fumadocs MDX)
- Configure Tailwind CSS?
- Install dependencies?

After that, it will initialize a new fumadocs app.
Now you can start hacking!

### Enjoy!

Create your first mdx file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see http://localhost:3000/docs.

```package-install
npm run dev
```

### Explore

In the project, you can see:

- `app/source.ts`: Where you organize code for the source adapter, it is used here to read from your content source.
- `app/layout.config.tsx`: Shared options for layouts, this is optional but preferred to keep.
- `app/(home)`: The route group for your landing page and other pages.
- `app/docs`: The entire docs.
- `app/api/search/route.ts`: The Route Handler for Search.

## FAQ

Some common questions you may encounter.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion id='why-fumadocs-ui' title="Why Fumadocs?">

        Feel free to open the demo in CodeSandbox and see if it suits you.

        - Many built-in components.
        - Integrations with Typescript Twoslash, OpenAPI, Math (KaTeX).
        - Flexible and Fast by default.
        - Built on App Router, no need for hydration over static content.
        - Use it in an existing Next.js project, without refactoring anything.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='customise' title='How to Customise UI?'>

        Fumadocs UI offers Themes, Blocks and Components.

        The design system is built with Tailwind CSS, see [Themes](/docs/ui/theme).

        Components are pre-built elements to enhance your documentation,
        they are customisable with exposed props like `style` and `className`.

        Blocks are essential elements of docs, providing navigation and basic functionality.
        We provided many options to customise them, see [Blocks](/docs/ui/blocks).

        Although the docs didn't explicitly mention, you can always style the elements with CSS selectors.

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='fix-monorepo-styling' title="How to fix stylings not being applied in Monorepo?">

        Sometimes, `fumadocs-ui` is not installed in the workspace of your Tailwind CSS configuration file. (e.g. a monorepo setup).

        When using the official Tailwind CSS plugin, it will not be able to find the files from `fumadocs-ui`
        package which contains all styling.

        To fix this, edit the Tailwind CSS configuration and replace `./node_modules` with `../../node_modules` in the `content` section.

        ```diff
        export default {
          content: [
        -   './node_modules/fumadocs-ui/dist/**/*.js',
        +   '../../node_modules/fumadocs-ui/dist/**/*.js',
            './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
            ...
          ],
        }
        ```

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='dynamic-route' title="It uses Dynamic Route, will it be poor in performance?">

        Next.js turns dynamic route into static routes when `generateStaticParams` is configured.
        Hence, it is as fast as static pages.

        You can enable Static Exports on Next.js to get a static build output. (Notice that Route Handler doesn't work with static export, you may use 3rd party search solutions like Algolia)

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='pronunciation' title='How to say Fumadocs?'>
        Fumadocs (Foo-ma docs).
    </Accordion>
