## Introduction

**Fumadocs is very flexible.** You can integrate with any content source, even without an official adapter.

> This guide assumes you are experienced with Next.js App Router.

For a custom content source implementation, you will need:

### Page Tree

You can either hardcode the page tree, or write some code to generate one.
See [Definitions of Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree).

Pass your Page Tree to `DocsLayout` (usually in a `layout.tsx`).

### Docs Page

Same as a normal Next.js app, the code of your docs page is located in `[[...slug]]/page.tsx`.

#### SSG

Define the [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) function.
It should return a list of parameters (`params`) to populate the `[[...slug]]` catch-all route.

#### Body

In the main body of page, find the corresponding page according to the slug and render its content inside the `DocsPage` component.

You also need a table of contents, which can be generated with your own implementation, or using the [`getTableOfContents`](/docs/headless/utils/get-toc) utility (Markdown/MDX only).

```tsx
import { DocsPage, DocsBody } from '@maximai/fumadocs-ui/page';
import { getPage } from './my-content-source';
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug?: string[] } }) {
  const page = getPage(params.slug);
  if (!page) notFound();

  return (
    <DocsPage toc={page.tableOfContents}>
      <DocsBody>{page.render()}</DocsBody>
    </DocsPage>
  );
}
```

#### Metadata

Next.js offers a Metadata API for SEO, you can configure it with `generateMetadata` (same as the code above).

### Document Search

This can be difficult considering your content may not be necessarily Markdown/MDX.
For Markdown and MDX, the built-in [Search API](/docs/headless/search/flexsearch) is adequate for most use cases.
Otherwise, you will have to bring your own implementation.

We recommend 3rd party solutions like Algolia Search. They are more flexible than the built-in Search API, and is easier to integrate with remote sources.
Fumadocs offers a simple [Algolia Search Adapter](/docs/headless/search/algolia), which includes a search client to integrate with Fumadocs UI.

## MDX Remote

Fumadocs offers the **MDX Remote** package, it is a helper to integrate remote content sources with Fumadocs.

<Callout type="warn" title="Take it on your own risk">
  MDX Remote is still under development, it can be unstable.
</Callout>

### Setup

```package-install
@fumadocs/mdx-remote
```

The main feature it offers is the MDX Compiler, it can compile MDX content to JSX nodes.
Since it doesn't use a bundler, imports and exports are not supported.

You can pass MDX components via the `components` option, it's compatible with Server Components.
There's an example:

```tsx
import { compileMDX } from '@fumadocs/mdx-remote';
import { getPage } from './my-content-source';
import { DocsBody, DocsPage } from '@maximai/fumadocs-ui/page';

export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug?: string[] } }) {
  const page = getPage(params.slug);
  const compiled = compileMDX({
    source: page.content,
    components: {},
  });

  return (
    <DocsPage toc={compiled.toc}>
      <DocsBody>{compiled.content}</DocsBody>
    </DocsPage>
  );
}
```
