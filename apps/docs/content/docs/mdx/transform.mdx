title: Transform
description: Runtime Transformation on collection entries
---

## Introduction

Fumadocs MDX bundles collection entries during build time, but this introduced some limitations on the configurations, forcing the output must be serializable.

You can use `transform` to transform collection entries on Next.js runtime.
It includes extra benefits:

- Unserializable output (e.g. functions)
- Server/Client Components
- Reference other parts of your Next.js apps

### How does it works?

This is possible by performing a transformation again on the bundled collection entries.
Everything is done on Next.js runtime, so using server/client components on `transform` is possible.

Be careful that:

- **Not cached by bundlers:** avoid expensive calculations in `transform`.
- **Use async imports:** Fumadocs MDX has to bundle the config file with esbuild before loading it. If importing a specific file results in errors, consider to use async import (`await import()`) instead.

### Usage

Pass a transform function.

```ts
import { defineCollections } from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

export const blog = defineCollections({
  type: 'doc',
  transform: (entry) => {
    return {
      ...entry,
      test: 'hello world',
    };
  },
  // other props
});
```

You can also use imports inside the function.

```ts
import React from 'react';
import { defineCollections } from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

export const blog = defineCollections({
  type: 'doc',
  transform: async (entry) => {
    const { Component } = await import('./my-server-component');
    return {
      ...entry,
      test: React.createElement(Component, {
        // props
      }),
    };
  },
  // other props
});
```

### Build-time Transform

To transform collection entries during build time, use [Schema](/docs/mdx/configuration#schema) with [Zod `transform`](https://zod.dev/?id=transform) instead.
