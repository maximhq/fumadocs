## Introduction

`fumadocs-mdx` is the official content source of Fumadocs. It parses frontmatter and is bundled with many MDX
plugins for building a good documentation site.

> This package must be used with Fumadocs

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```package-install
fumadocs-mdx @types/mdx
```

### Configuration

Add the plugin to your `next.config.mjs` file.

```js
import createMDX from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';

const withMDX = createMDX();

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const config = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
};

export default withMDX(config);
```

It generates a `.map.ts` file once you start the dev server or start building the app.
The map file contains all parsed files, you should add it to `.gitignore`.

<Callout title="ESM Only" type='warn' className="mt-4">

The Next.js config must be a `.mjs` file since Fumadocs is ESM-only.

</Callout>

### Define MDX Components

Create `mdx-components.tsx` in your root directory.

```tsx
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types';
// Assume you're using Fumadocs UI
import defaultComponents from '@maximai/fumadocs-ui/mdx';

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    ...defaultComponents,
    ...components,
  };
}
```

### Resolve Files

To integrate with Fumadocs, create:

```ts title="app/source.ts"
import { map } from '@/.map';
import { createMDXSource } from 'fumadocs-mdx';
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';

export const { getPage, getPages, pageTree } = loader({
  baseUrl: '/docs',
  rootDir: 'docs',
  source: createMDXSource(map),
});
```

> For more customisation options, check [Source API](/docs/headless/source-api).

### Start Server

```bash
next dev
```

A `.map.ts` file should be created. You can log and see if it is loaded correctly.

See [Pages Conventions](/docs/ui/page-conventions)
to learn how to organize your pages.

## FAQ

### Built-in Properties

These properties are exported from MDX files by default.

| Property         | Description                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `frontmatter`    | Frontmatter                                     |
| `toc`            | Table of Contents                               |
| `structuredData` | Structured Data, useful for implementing search |

### MDX Plugins

You can customise the options passed to the MDX processor.

```js
import createMDX from 'fumadocs-mdx/config';
import rehypeKatex from 'rehype-katex';
import remarkMath from 'remark-math';

const withMDX = createMDX({
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkMath],
    // When order matters
    rehypePlugins: (v) => [rehypeKatex, ...v],
  },
});
```

See [Configuration](/docs/mdx/configuration) to learn more.

### What is the `.map` file?

The `.map` file is generated by our Webpack plugin in build time.
It includes the information of files under your content directory,
which can be access by your Next.js app to implement SSG and many other features.

## Deep Dive

### How does it work?

Fumadocs MDX is a webpack plugin over Next.js to support reading/importing a MDX file by its name.
Because Next.js could only optimize static imports, it first generates a map file that imports **all supported files** under the root directory.

The imported files form an array called `map` in your `.map.ts` file, so that your Next.js app can access them without manually importing all of them.
